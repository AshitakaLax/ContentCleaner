1
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:11,251
Please don't touch it.

2
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:12,389
Excuse me.

3
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:20,479
Gus, Gus, Gus!

4
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:21,929
Where's your project, Shawn?

5
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:23,637
- Did you even do it?
- My project?

6
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:24,687
Of course I did it.

7
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:25,853
When?

8
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,898
When?

9
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,005
Last night.

10
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,052
It's right here.

11
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,997
This head
is to exact scale.

12
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:33,018
It took me three months
to make it.

13
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,074
Yours took five minutes.

14
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:37,217
No, Gus, you're totally wrong.

15
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:39,097
It took me a whole hour.

16
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,575
Check this out.

17
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,281
I hate you, Shawn.

18
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:14,100
Lompoc.

19
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,457
Okay, I did it.

20
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:23,086
That's seven in row.

21
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:25,139
Eight... the gas station guy
confessed last week!

22
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:26,926
Oh, I wouldn't
call myself a hero.

23
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:28,915
I'm just doing my job
just like all of you.

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,130
Hey, that's enough
goofing off.

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,489
Let's get back
to work, huh?

26
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:32,650
You too.

27
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,075
Ladies and gentlemen,

28
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:35,368
Detective Lassiter!

29
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:37,248
Oh, stop it!

30
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:43,018
- Jules!
- Shawn.

31
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:45,684
- Is there a problem?
- With what?

32
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:47,770
With you. With me.
With the Chief.

33
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:49,902
She hasn't called
in a month.

34
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,344
Is she still mad about me
requisitioning the Segway?

35
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:53,589
You did that?

36
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:55,457
No.

37
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:57,634
Well, I don't really

38
00:01:57,678 --> 00:02:00,838
have time right now,
but the short answer is

39
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,186
we just haven't really needed
any outside help.

40
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:04,860
Well, what's the long answer?

41
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,549
I mean,
throw a "but" in there

42
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:08,014
and add something
about a dream

43
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:10,041
where you and I got thrown out
of a mattress showroom.

44
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:12,367
Detective Lassiter
is literally on fire.

45
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:13,649
What kind of fire
are we talking about?

46
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:15,489
Michael Jackson
in the Pepsi commercial fire

47
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,444
or misusing the word
"literally" fire?

48
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:20,003
He's solved eight cases
in a row fire.

49
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:23,334
Nine... I just rembered
the DeShano case.

50
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:25,080
Hey, Shawn.
What's new?

51
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,638
You still doing
the psychic thing?

52
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:30,419
Is this some sort of
weird dream?

53
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:32,745
On the last two cases,
the first suspect

54
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:34,325
Lassiter questioned confessed.

55
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,562
It's really magnificent.

56
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:38,457
We are talking about
Carlton Lassiter, right?

57
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:39,534
Yea high?

58
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,877
Bats ninth for the department
softball team?

59
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:43,340
Tenth.
We play with a rover.

60
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,048
Spencer, long time, no see.

61
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,400
Or is that no need?

62
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:50,797
I can't believe this.

63
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,984
Oh, believe it.
It's real.

64
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,664
They've done a preliminary
on the body down

65
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,891
at the marina, Detective.

66
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:57,316
They're ready for you
at the scene.

67
00:02:57,393 --> 00:02:59,509
Well, I would love
to stay and chat,

68
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,598
but duty does call.

69
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:04,244
Oh, Spencer, you look so sad.

70
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:08,257
Come on, we'll show you
how real cops do it.

71
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,264
No comeback?

72
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,855
Shawn, that's
slightly embarrassing.

73
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:19,357
Where'd you get that... suit?
The toilet store?

74
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,601
Good luck with this one,
Detective.

75
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,390
There's no identification.

76
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:39,779
Nobody's been reported missing
fitting this description.

77
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:42,123
Oh, Mr. Spencer.

78
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,012
I'm surprised
you didn't take the Segway.

79
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:45,487
She did know about that.

80
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:46,637
O'Hara just told me.

81
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:48,255
Traitor.

82
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,529
I'll deal with you later.

83
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,544
So what's the new
case we've got?

84
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:58,588
A slight error
in grammar there, buddy.

85
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,931
Which part?
"Got. "

86
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,240
I came all the way down
from the office, Shawn.

87
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:04,333
Gus, don't be
a giant snapping turtle.

88
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:07,024
We'll have a case
in five minutes.

89
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,974
Nobody can explain
these puncture wounds.

90
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,963
We can't rule out
an animal attack.

91
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:23,217
No... no, there's nothing
in these waters

92
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:24,852
with a bite radius that large.

93
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,626
No, this is maybe
a... boating accident.

94
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:31,247
The wounds caused by
some machinery.

95
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,368
I can't really be sure
at this juncture.

96
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,699
Completely stumped.

97
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:37,751
You getting something,

98
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:38,878
Mr. Spencer?

99
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:41,339
Yes.

100
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,339
Yes, I am.

101
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,308
No, no, no! No, hold on.
Okay, I've got it.

102
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,260
The wound on the head

103
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:54,161
was caused by the edge
of a boat

104
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:57,312
when he fell in the water
unconscious.

105
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:59,036
And the wounds on the back,

106
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:02,186
they were caused by a large
industrial crab trap.

107
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:05,993
Or a whale.

108
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,506
It definitely
could've been a whale.

109
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,634
Lost from his pod.

110
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:12,241
Separated, migrating
north or south.

111
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:15,277
And sees our man dead,
already floating up

112
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:16,172
above the surface.

113
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:19,559
Thinks it's a seal
and then... whale.

114
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:21,668
A whale?

115
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,779
What's your guy got?

116
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,547
Watch and learn, Jules.

117
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:25,597
Watch and learn.

118
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:26,756
Or...
Detective,

119
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:27,563
if you don't mind,

120
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:30,299
I'd like to see what
Mr. Spencer has to offer.

121
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:33,172
All right, look,

122
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,094
this is gonna be
a little rough, okay?

123
00:05:35,194 --> 00:05:36,649
I didn't have time
for shading.

124
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,351
There's no forced perspective.

125
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:39,666
If I had really
had my druthers,

126
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:40,567
I would've done it
in charcoal.

127
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:41,865
You know what
I'm talking about.

128
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,666
Look, what I'm trying
to say is,

129
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:44,671
I'm not the artist
I'd like to be...

130
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:45,771
Okay, Mr. Spencer, enough.

131
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,975
Can you or can you not
tell us who's responsible

132
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:48,720
for this man's death?

133
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:51,388
If I can present you
with a semi-accurate sketch

134
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:53,565
of the culprit, is that enough
to get us on this case?

135
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:55,369
Yes.

136
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:57,069
All right.

137
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:58,307
The puncture wounds.

138
00:05:58,373 --> 00:05:59,357
They're the key.

139
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,075
Giving me the impression
that this crime could only

140
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:06,208
have been committed...
by this guy.

141
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,405
This guy here.

142
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:18,979
Excuse me.

143
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:20,739
What?

144
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:22,999
Chief?

145
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:25,296
Where are you off to?

146
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:28,057
So what, that's a no?

147
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:29,709
Gus!

148
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,493
This is not a boating accident.

149
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:41,353
# I know you know #

150
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,121
# That I'm not telling
the truth #

151
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:44,816
# I know you know #

152
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,507
# They just don't have
any proof #

153
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:47,844
# Where's the deception? #

154
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:49,236
# Learn how to bend #

155
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,226
# Your worst inhibitions #

156
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,435
# Tend to psych you out
in the end #

157
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,988
You're mad.

158
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:05,866
No, I'm not mad. I'm happy.

159
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,496
I'm thrilled. I love looking
like an idiot.

160
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,954
Well, that explains
your shoes.

161
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,751
You almost closed down
our agency

162
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,092
with that little act
of yours, Shawn.

163
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:14,123
Me?

164
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,825
You're the one spending
all your extra time

165
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,317
at your little
"side project. "

166
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:19,312
You mean my real job?

167
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:21,288
Soon to be my only job?

168
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:23,155
Gus, you're panicking.
Don't panic.

169
00:07:23,216 --> 00:07:26,012
Those bite marks are consistent
with a tyrannosaurus bite.

170
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,840
You know that.
Yes, I know that.

171
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:29,974
The hard way.

172
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:32,797
I was canned from the Wyoming
Natural History Museum

173
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:33,858
for that little shot.

174
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:36,465
The bruises from the teeth
didn't go away for a year,

175
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:37,575
but totally worth it.

176
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,482
It was my best
screensaver ever.

177
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:42,554
Gus, please, connecting
a dinosaur to this case

178
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:43,885
is the least of our worries.

179
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:45,708
Look, I can I stash
a toy dinosaur

180
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:46,614
in the window of the killer.

181
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,178
I can link him to a box
of Dino Bites or Fruity Pebbles.

182
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:54,327
I can play Six Degrees of Dinosaur
with you right now.

183
00:07:56,795 --> 00:07:59,082
You've never been in a movie
with Kevin Bacon

184
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:00,303
or a Dilaposaurus, have you?

185
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:03,662
How about you play
Six Degrees of Kiss My Ass?

186
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,390
First of all, that sounds like
a totally disturbing game.

187
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,722
What's weird is that my guess
on the jaw radius

188
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:10,438
was actually spot on.

189
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,510
It almost seems to make sense.

190
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:16,415
So now you're getting on board
with your own joke theory?

191
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,327
How are you gonna match
your bite radius

192
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:19,410
to the victim, Shawn?

193
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:22,061
Drag the body
to the Wyoming museum?

194
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:26,371
I can do you one better.

195
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,675
What?

196
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,830
I need to borrow
my dad's truck.

197
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:32,594
You coming or what?

198
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:34,752
That's clearly a no.

199
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:37,277
The one thing we can be sure of is

200
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:39,564
the cause of death
was not drowning.

201
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:42,641
Blunt force trauma
to the head was severe enough

202
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:43,967
to knock him unconscious.

203
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:46,586
More than likely he fell
from some sort of

204
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:49,414
a platform after
knocking himself on the head.

205
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,227
And this is how he ended up
in the water?

206
00:08:51,293 --> 00:08:53,050
No, he landed
on something hard.

207
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:54,709
Dislocated a rib.

208
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:57,376
He has bruises consistent
with a six, seven,

209
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:58,525
or eight-foot fall.

210
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:00,702
My guess is that he landed
on something else

211
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:04,619
and ultimately expired
before tumbling into the water.

212
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:06,177
You know, this might be a leap,

213
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:08,088
but I would check
the offshore oil rigs.

214
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,210
See if any of them
are missing workers.

215
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:11,985
I'll make some calls.

216
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:13,545
Interesting, Detective.

217
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:14,644
Thanks, Chief.

218
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:16,881
This theory feels good.
Just makes sense.

219
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,317
The work boots, the odd
configuration of the wounds.

220
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,367
You know us, Ted.
It's worth a shot, right?

221
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:22,947
- We don't go out on limbs too often...
- Thanks, guys.

222
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:24,731
I just need
to measure something.

223
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:28,252
Oh, good!

224
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,879
You're all here.
Get ready to be shocked.

225
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:33,048
Can we get the sheet
off the dead guy, please?

226
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:34,642
Confirming the bite radius...

227
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:36,791
No! Mr. Spencer...

228
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:38,910
Whoa, hey, hey, be careful.
This isn't mine.

229
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:41,612
Mr. Spencer, your antics
have always been a little...

230
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,409
let's say unorthodox.

231
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,111
But let me be as frank
as I can be

232
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,730
with my assessment
of your most recent behavior.

233
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:49,000
Seek help.

234
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:52,542
Chief, sometimes
you have to jump off a cliff.

235
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:53,868
You have to close your eyes.

236
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:56,393
You have to unhook
your clip "chasses"...

237
00:09:57,322 --> 00:09:58,383
Chassis?

238
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:02,758
Climbing thing...

239
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:04,858
and you have to leap.

240
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,460
Now I ask you, Chief...

241
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,284
will you leap with me?

242
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:11,974
Are you thinking about
jumping off a cliff?

243
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:14,107
Maybe.

244
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:26,946
Dad!

245
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:29,795
I've brought the keys back.
Hello!

246
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,742
Okay, this is creepy.
Why is Gus here?

247
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,384
Why do you think, Shawn?

248
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,041
He's a hostage.

249
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,423
Perhaps I can shed
some light on that.

250
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,257
Two hostages.

251
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,841
Doug Devette is an old colleague
of mine from the force.

252
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:47,941
The Chief asked me
to have him drop by.

253
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:49,909
Why?

254
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:53,021
Doug is the department
psychologist, Shawn.

255
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,408
What is this, some sort
of intervention?

256
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:56,535
Yeah, sort of.

257
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:59,552
We don't like to use the term
"intervention," Shawn.

258
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:01,019
Gus?

259
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:01,759
Don't look at me.

260
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:03,483
I'm here for the cupcakes.

261
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,327
Dad, I am not on drugs.

262
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:07,531
Oh, nobody thinks that, Shawn.

263
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:09,078
Well, I'm not completely
sure about that, Doug.

264
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,459
We're all just
a little concerned

265
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:11,823
that you might be
stretching yourself

266
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:12,807
a bit too thin.

267
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:14,447
It wasn't my idea,
but he's right, Shawn.

268
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,889
You're acting like a nut job.

269
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:18,696
Just because I take
Gus' giant dinosaur

270
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,580
head down to a dead body
does not make me a nut job.

271
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:22,867
What?

272
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,605
You took my T-Rex?

273
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,986
My mom gave it to you?

274
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:27,478
Gladly.

275
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:30,185
She also gave me some pictures
you can pay me to not show

276
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,771
your next girlfriend.

277
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:31,577
What pictures?

278
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,958
The ones that document
your Terence Trent

279
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:34,174
D'Arby phase.

280
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:36,653
Whatever, Shawn.

281
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,454
You took Danny Dino
to the police station?

282
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:41,371
No, Gus, give me some credit.

283
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:43,009
I took him to the morgue.

284
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,317
Good news.

285
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:47,245
Your specifications
were spot on.

286
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:52,709
Your father tells me you have
delusions of magical powers.

287
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,226
Delusions?
Really.

288
00:11:56,254 --> 00:11:58,773
Doug, I'm employed as a psychic.

289
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:01,204
I've solved 18 cases this year.

290
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:03,446
I have business cards
and a personalized coffee mug

291
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,949
that backs up the whole thing.

292
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:07,883
I feel things about people.

293
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:14,380
You, for instance,
are color blind.

294
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:16,612
That's nothing
to be ashamed off.

295
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,332
You're also really stressed
about something.

296
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:29,811
College.

297
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:32,253
It can be very expensive, Doug.

298
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,811
Oh, that was good, Henry.

299
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,722
Doug, do not be a stooge.

300
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,573
Not a stooge, but in this
one case, he was right.

301
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:41,826
Knock at door.

302
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:44,741
Karen, do you mind?

303
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:46,067
We're in the middle
of an intervention here.

304
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:46,925
We don't have time for that.

305
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,092
But you're the one
who asked for this.

306
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:48,866
And I thank you, Henry,

307
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:50,053
but I'm afraid
that this can't wait.

308
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,583
We just got a break
in the case.

309
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:53,506
We just found out
the name of the dead man.

310
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,252
You want to tell him
who he is, Detective?

311
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,721
No.

312
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,520
His name was
Christopher Franzen.

313
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,440
He is a paleontologist.

314
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:09,278
A dinosaur hunter.

315
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,638
As expected.

316
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,428
Doug...

317
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:14,715
pleasure was all mine.

318
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:16,245
Oh, no, Shawn, mine.

319
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:17,609
We should get together.

320
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,160
All right, here's
what we know so far.

321
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:27,398
A man, a paleontology professor,
washes ashore with wounds

322
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:28,602
specific to a dinosaur.

323
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:31,323
I don't think we can rule out
the possibility of island

324
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,566
somewhere in the Pacific
where dinosaurs do exist.

325
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:35,411
And have an appetite
for Jeff Goldblum.

326
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:36,237
I'm being serious, Shawn.

327
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:39,022
Well, look who's Mr. Onboard
and sounding like

328
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,074
a whacked wombat.

329
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:40,892
Then what is it?

330
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:41,959
I don't know.

331
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:44,541
It actually scares me
that my wild dinosaur reach

332
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,437
landed so close
to the bull's-eye.

333
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:49,277
This guy was possibly killed
by something dinosaur-related,

334
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,741
but it was probably a model
or something from

335
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:52,967
the archaeology department.

336
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:53,851
We'll have to spend
the better part

337
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,365
of the next 24 hours
sifting through

338
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:56,812
their entire collection
of artifacts.

339
00:13:56,851 --> 00:14:00,018
And by "we" I mean mostly you.

340
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:06,851
This is all there is?

341
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:08,899
No. No, no, no.

342
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:09,805
This is just the big stuff.

343
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:12,023
We got the trilobites
in a shoebox,

344
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:14,874
but the shelf is kind of high.

345
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:18,494
You've got Pinhead, Chatterbox,
Surgeon, and Stitch

346
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:19,351
up there on a shelf?

347
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:21,174
Shawn, those are Cenobites.

348
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,551
Well, what are trilobites?

349
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:24,268
Fish fossils.

350
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,174
Oh, Gus, for my sake,
at least pretend like

351
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:28,892
you don't know this stuff
off the top of your head.

352
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,339
Do this move.

353
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:33,281
Trilo... trilobite?

354
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:34,051
What... it'll help you!

355
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:34,722
I'm serious.

356
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,972
Look, Ethan, I can honestly say

357
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,719
there were more
historically significant items

358
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:41,891
in the lost and found at the Taco
John's in Porterville.

359
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,338
Yeah.

360
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:45,277
Yeah, it's a little sad.

361
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:49,299
Word is the whole program
is going under.

362
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:50,706
You sure about that?

363
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,203
Look, Professor Franzen
would never really give us

364
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:54,092
a straight answer.

365
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,833
In fact, most nights he wasn't
around to give us any answers.

366
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:58,612
He was a pretty crappy advisor.

367
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,778
And when he did show up,
he was late, tired,

368
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:02,258
completely disheveled.

369
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,851
Nobody really trusted the guy.

370
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:06,468
Look, do not ever take
a class from him.

371
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:07,501
He's dead.

372
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:08,783
Oh, yeah.

373
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,647
Then totally.

374
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,411
Well, this sure was a dead end.

375
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,789
Yep, but at least we were
the first ones

376
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,303
to find the dead end.

377
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:24,896
Oh, come on!

378
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:27,504
He really is on fire.

379
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:29,182
Literally.

380
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,562
I don't get this.

381
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,412
The cops beat us
to the dead guy's house.

382
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:37,578
I don't know how I feel
about the police department

383
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:38,651
being so proactive.

384
00:15:38,682 --> 00:15:40,184
Feeling the heat?

385
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:42,041
What, do you think I'm afraid
of a little competition?

386
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:43,643
I know you're afraid
of competion.

387
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:45,548
Why else would you have
purposefully broken

388
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:46,919
the Battlezone at Pizza Royale?

389
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:48,134
Dude, you beat me once.

390
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,330
And only because you first

391
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,739
used the eye piece and then
revealed you had pinkeye.

392
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:00,826
Let's venture off
the beaten path.

393
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:09,747
What's wrong?

394
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,912
I'm just trying to figure out
what to do here,

395
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:13,768
since as a rule we don't
break and enter.

396
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:15,436
What do you mean
we don't break and enter?

397
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,105
The 2400 Motel.

398
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:18,037
The Hotel de la Cruz.

399
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,174
The spellmaster's box.

400
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,959
Yeah, but we really
shouldn't pick this lock.

401
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,583
You know I want
to pick that lock.

402
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,632
Yes, I do.

403
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,081
Watch out.

404
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:33,882
What are you, the lock whisper?

405
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,657
Are you channeling
Michael Jackson?

406
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:39,698
Who heard the second click?

407
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:41,068
I heard the second click.

408
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,730
Really?

409
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,222
Come on.

410
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,759
I can't see anything.

411
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:01,770
Oh, I got it, I got it.

412
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,135
Gus, that thing is
brighter than the sun.

413
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:08,472
Think you just gave me glaucoma.

414
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:10,792
You can't give someone
glaucoma.

415
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,093
Thank you.

416
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:19,162
This is better than the entire
university department.

417
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:20,197
It sure is.

418
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:23,006
And his digging equipment
is some heavy duty stuff.

419
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:25,299
Looks like some shovels
are missing.

420
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:29,325
Part of a portable light kit.

421
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:32,482
A lot of brushes.

422
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:38,690
And fine finishing equipment,
which I would assume

423
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,340
he was only using in the lab.

424
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:44,854
Dude, I got something.
What?

425
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,693
He was the worst
tic-tac-toe player

426
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:47,599
in the history of the world.

427
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:50,167
I'm investigating and you're
analyzing his doodles?

428
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,710
Doodles are the window
to the soul, Gus.

429
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,433
Or maybe that's the epiglottis.

430
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:57,403
Where's the uvula?

431
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:58,906
Lassiter's here.

432
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:02,111
That guy's like five minutes
behind us everywhere we go.

433
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:05,058
Don't sleep in the nude tonight.

434
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,351
Spencer.

435
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:19,231
Enjoying your time
riding my behind?

436
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,308
Definitely not in the nude.

437
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:23,302
This lock looks too high tech
for a backyard shed.

438
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:24,924
We gotta find somebody
who can crack the code.

439
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,399
There's already someone
here who can do that.

440
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:30,234
That person... is me.

441
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,520
Well, make yourself useful.

442
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:36,397
I'll need you
to step back, please.

443
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:38,286
Give me some room to operate.

444
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:42,726
Further, please.

445
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:45,227
Further.

446
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:46,410
Jules, could you
help me out here?

447
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:48,708
Just get him back
onto the cobblestone.

448
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,663
That's good, that's good.

449
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:53,199
Thank you.

450
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:58,126
I am sensing
the first two digits.

451
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:02,008
What is it, 31?

452
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,157
Gus, help me out here.

453
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:04,251
Come on, buddy.

454
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:07,621
You can have my
Tony Gwynn rookie. 25.

455
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,513
25!

456
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,038
Eight?

457
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:15,334
Three.

458
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:16,837
Three!

459
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,154
Four?

460
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:19,889
Two.

461
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:22,577
And... two.

462
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:23,927
There's one more.

463
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:25,851
Wait!

464
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,093
There's one more.

465
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:29,325
Nine.

466
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:43,455
That was amazing.

467
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,418
I'll give you that one.

468
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:50,310
Can't see a thing in here.

469
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:50,940
Oh, I've got it.

470
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:53,107
Wait, I'm sensing a light switch.

471
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:57,184
Tools are missing.

472
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:59,128
Good work, Detective.

473
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:02,123
He had a blunt force
trauma.

474
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:04,012
That could be supplied
by one of these missing items.

475
00:20:04,113 --> 00:20:07,927
Maybe this rock hammer
or this medium shovel.

476
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:09,551
But where would they be?

477
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:11,128
The bed of his pickup.

478
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,504
It wasn't parked out front
or at the university.

479
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:16,063
We find that truck,
we find the murder weapon.

480
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,134
Let's go, O'Hara.

481
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,383
Burning daylight.

482
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:20,627
Excuse us.

483
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:24,517
Man, you missed the truck?

484
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,198
I'm not the psychic.

485
00:20:31,776 --> 00:20:33,035
What?

486
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:37,170
Why would someone
frequent a fruit stand

487
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,137
that's over 50 miles away?

488
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,319
They like pomegranate?

489
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:54,393
Yeah, I know him.

490
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:55,970
He was my best customer.

491
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,270
Don't know his name.

492
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:59,894
But he comes by
every night before closing.

493
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:01,651
Did you ever see
which way he went?

494
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,611
Yeah.

495
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,861
Always up the hill.

496
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:06,177
That's all I see.

497
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:08,666
Although every once in a while

498
00:21:08,752 --> 00:21:11,863
I see him come back down the hill
early in the morning.

499
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:14,291
Well, thank you very much.

500
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,152
Gus, you got anything else?

501
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:17,009
Yes, is that peach pie in the back?

502
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:17,721
Yeah.

503
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,362
Another dead end.

504
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:40,629
Let's turn around.

505
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:44,935
Hold on a second.

506
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:58,717
This looks like a place
someone's been sneaking into.

507
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:10,031
What is this?

508
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,478
Looks like some kind of farmland

509
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,684
or grazing plain.

510
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:14,950
Oh, look at that.

511
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:18,051
It's like that movie.
The one with Sigourney Weaver.

512
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,917
- Aliens?
- No.

513
00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:21,822
- Alien.
- No.

514
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,929
Alien: Resurrection.

515
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:25,149
Gus, the one with the holes
and Shia LaBeouf.

516
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,552
They had holes in Shia LaBeouf?

517
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:29,488
The holes are in the ground,
dude, like that.

518
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:32,025
And Jon Voight was walking
around all crazy.

519
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:33,181
Oh,Anaconda.

520
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:35,283
Yeah, never mind.

521
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:36,250
Gorillas in the Mist?

522
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,385
- Death and the Maiden?
- No!

523
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:39,512
Half Moon Street?

524
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:41,221
Just let it go.

525
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:47,612
I'll be damned.

526
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:48,657
What?!

527
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:50,225
Somebody's shooting at us!

528
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,051
Oh, God! They're shooting!

529
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:55,475
We're gonna die!

530
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,249
Run, Gus!

531
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:57,694
Gus, run like the wind!

532
00:22:57,768 --> 00:22:59,280
No... get... get up!

533
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:07,038
Come on, get in the car!

534
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:08,489
Hurry up, Shawn!

535
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,250
Start it, start it!

536
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:12,097
Go, go, go!

537
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:14,958
Dude, look at the road
while you're driving!

538
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,066
- I'm staying down for safety.
- He was shooting

539
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:18,370
directly into the air, Gus.

540
00:23:18,394 --> 00:23:20,004
Bullets go up. They have to come down.

541
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:22,323
Do you know what the trajectory
would have to be for that to happen?

542
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:23,983
Don't you dare argue physics with me.

543
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:26,037
Not while we're in the process
of almost being killed.

544
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:36,942
Didn't you see the
"Trespassers Will Be Shot" sign?

545
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:39,721
Oh, yeah.

546
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,129
It totally said that.

547
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,711
My bad.

548
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:50,452
Mr. Spencer, if you have any
substantial information concerning

549
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:53,463
the Christopher Franzen case,
please get on with it.

550
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:55,247
I've got something.

551
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:57,414
It's a cluck.

552
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:58,693
A cluck?

553
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:04,529
Actually there's two.

554
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:05,587
Two clucks.

555
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:07,109
A cluck-cluck here.

556
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:14,983
A bawk-bawk... there.

557
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:17,138
Here a bawk.
There a...

558
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,703
Cluck?

559
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:20,980
Everywhere a bawk-baaawk.

560
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:22,480
Let me guess. You have a name.

561
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:24,607
MacDonald, perhaps?

562
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:26,710
No. No, it's a farm.

563
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:28,106
With a farmer. An old farmer.

564
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:30,408
Farmer... Shooty Pants.

565
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:31,561
That's a nickname.

566
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:33,765
- I don't think that's his actual handle.
- I've got it.

567
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:35,776
Lassiter found
the paleontologist's truck.

568
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,350
- You helped.
- I did help.

569
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:38,333
It was his hunch.

570
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,548
It was down at the old marina.
I just had a feeling.

571
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,554
I also found the prints of a certain
grad student named Ethan Robinson

572
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:47,033
along with a stack of letters from said
grad students demanding the professor

573
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:48,382
stop ruining his life.

574
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:50,242
We're sending a car over
to pick him up.

575
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:53,740
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting your trance?

576
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,368
I don't buy it.

577
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:56,143
Which part?

578
00:24:56,356 --> 00:24:59,098
The damning evidence
or the murder weapon?

579
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,692
There's more going on in
this guy's life. Chief, I'm sensing...

580
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,820
digging.

581
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:09,929
Yeah, the archaeology
department was going under.

582
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,244
He was trying to make a big discovery.

583
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:13,212
Put him on the map, get more funding.

584
00:25:13,358 --> 00:25:14,361
The farm.

585
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:16,011
I can see the name of the farm.

586
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:17,595
It's Wallll...

587
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:20,301
Wall...

588
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:25,439
Walker Farms. Yeah, we got that lead
off the phone records... Yesterday.

589
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,844
Apparently our victim made
a series of phone calls

590
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:30,935
to the farmer trying to buy some
of his land, but it wasn't for sale.

591
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:33,097
Farmer was forthcoming, cooperative.

592
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:34,252
Definitely not a suspect.

593
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,457
Anything else?

594
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,402
I have to say,
you have been very through.

595
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:40,800
We're just doing what
any good cops would do.

596
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,246
- Shawn, what are you doing?
- Yeah, what are we doing, Shawn?

597
00:25:53,242 --> 00:25:55,369
- I need to borrow some tools.
- What kind of tools?

598
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:58,208
Digging tools. A little excavation
project we got going on.

599
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:01,053
- Are you still on that dinosaur thing?
- We're still on that dinosaur thing?

600
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,022
What, is there an echo in here?
Yes, we're still on the dinosaur thing.

601
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,161
We step foot on the far end
of this guy Walker's farm in Ojai

602
00:26:07,162 --> 00:26:08,956
and he starts blasting us
with buckshot.

603
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:11,498
We know our dead guy was there
every night leading up to his death,

604
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,686
digging around the periphery
of this property.

605
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:15,475
No, Shawn, wait.

606
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,038
I don't want you borrowing my tools.

607
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:19,101
Oh, Gus will leave
his class ring as collateral.

608
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:19,875
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.

609
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,801
- No, I won't.
- Sure you will.

610
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:21,401
No, I won't.

611
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:22,631
I can't support this.

612
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:24,497
Well, there's a shocker.

613
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:26,046
You not being supportive.

614
00:26:26,082 --> 00:26:27,091
Would you shut up and listen?

615
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm saying I can't support you going
somewhere where you could get shot.

616
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:32,949
What, are you...
Are you worried about me?

617
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,321
Shawn, I've been worried about you
since you were three years old

618
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:37,583
and started eating your own toenails.

619
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:39,247
Well,

620
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:40,559
Dad, I'll be fine, okay?

621
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,060
We're not gonna go
anywhere near the house.

622
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:45,282
And if it'll make you feel any better,
I will stand behind Gus the entire time.

623
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:46,110
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

624
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,303
- No, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I will.

625
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:47,733
You want to bet?

626
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,781
I don't like it.

627
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,218
It doesn't feel right.

628
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,084
I know feelings.

629
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,574
Pardon me? Did...

630
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,627
Did you just say... "I know feelings"?

631
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,562
Perfect.

632
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:04,890
This will be easy.

633
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,713
Oh, there's a pattern here.

634
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,606
Those guys dig with a reason.

635
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:09,836
How do you know that?

636
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:13,669
Gus, I worked at the museum for almost
an entire weekend before I got canned.

637
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:18,187
<i>He was the worst tic-tac-toe player
in the history of the world.</i>

638
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:20,075
Wait a second.

639
00:27:21,268 --> 00:27:22,712
Those weren't tic-tac-toe boards.

640
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:24,397
Those were all the places he'd dug.

641
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:25,928
There were like 25 Xs.

642
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:27,345
No way he scored that often.

643
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:28,845
The Xs were misses.

644
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:31,785
In this case, "O" marks the spot.

645
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:43,893
And that's the "O."

646
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:55,292
This is the only hole
filled by a bulldozer.

647
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:58,640
No self-respecting paleontologist
would use a bulldozer.

648
00:28:00,332 --> 00:28:01,353
Why do you know that?

649
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:02,705
Because, Shawn, if you use a bull...

650
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,546
- Gus, I don't actually want to know.
- Then don't ask.

651
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,415
This shouldn't take long. Grab a shovel.

652
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:12,625
And keep an eye out for that farmer.

653
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:23,753
- How you doing on your side?
- Good, solid.

654
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,610
I'm holding up.

655
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:27,663
- Shawn!
- What?

656
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,030
I'm keeping watch.
That's how the other guy died.

657
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:33,977
What, you're not concerned?

658
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:38,516
All right, I get it!

659
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,668
It's my turn.

660
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:48,440
This is the end of the loose dirt.
Be careful.

661
00:28:54,993 --> 00:28:56,062
This is weird.

662
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,447
What, that there's rocks in the ground?

663
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,001
These aren't rocks.

664
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:02,941
These are fossils.

665
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:05,832
But they've been processed,
finished off, residue,

666
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:06,914
rocks chipped away.

667
00:29:07,344 --> 00:29:09,305
Stuff you would normally do in a lab.

668
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:11,543
Franzen found something.

669
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,427
Why wouldn't he just take it out

670
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:18,244
and do the work in the lab
where it should be done?

671
00:29:20,673 --> 00:29:21,964
Unless...

672
00:29:22,788 --> 00:29:24,227
Unless it was too big to move.

673
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,026
Oh, dude, I'm gonna get the leaf blower.

674
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:30,205
You brought a leaf blower?

675
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:46,414
You gotta be kidding me.

676
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:49,672
I just discovered a dinosaur.

677
00:29:57,139 --> 00:29:59,905
Filling that hole was
the worst idea ever.

678
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:02,453
It had to be done, Gus.

679
00:30:02,454 --> 00:30:05,195
We have to save it for when
we unmask Franzen's killer.

680
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,100
I still don't get it.

681
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:10,683
He was on the trail of
a fossil graveyard.

682
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,632
It lead him right to Deacon Farms.

683
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:15,272
Farmer wouldn't let him
dig on the land, so

684
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:18,113
he takes matters into his
own hands after hours.

685
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,941
But why wouldn't the farmer let him dig?

686
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:22,919
Maybe he didn't want his farm disturbed.

687
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:27,820
A dig like that is worth
millions to a land owner.

688
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:30,650
And the fossils I discovered
weren't even on crop land.

689
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,718
You discovered?

690
00:30:31,755 --> 00:30:33,853
Don't try to take away
my dinosaur discovery, Shawn.

691
00:30:33,914 --> 00:30:34,696
I wouldn't dream of it.

692
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:37,106
I'm sorry. It was all you.
I'm very proud of you.

693
00:30:37,928 --> 00:30:40,055
Don't you think once
they unearth that thing

694
00:30:40,056 --> 00:30:43,050
there would be a swarm of people
crashing in from all over the world?

695
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:44,791
Why didn't he just lease the land?

696
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:46,202
I don't get it.

697
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:49,830
- I've got an idea.
- What?

698
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,293
Let's ask him.

699
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:52,479
What?!

700
00:30:52,614 --> 00:30:54,791
We're pretty sure we just found
a cold-blooded murderer,

701
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,795
and you want to go to his house
and ask him about it?

702
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:58,369
We can ask nicely.
No!

703
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:00,905
All right, all right.
We come up with a cover story.

704
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:02,549
We're vacuum salesmen.

705
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,606
No...

706
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:05,119
Traveling gypsies.

707
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,439
No, no, no!

708
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,685
We'll do Of Mice and Men.

709
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,617
- I'm Lennie.
- No.

710
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:14,274
"George, you said that I could
take care of those rabbits, George."

711
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:14,803
Shawn.

712
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:17,264
"And later on you're gonna
cook those beets. "

713
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:17,854
Shawn!

714
00:31:17,905 --> 00:31:19,011
"Beets make me go... "

715
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:20,216
No Lennie.

716
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,493
Gus, you know how long
I've been waiting to pull out my Lennie?

717
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,996
No, Shawn, we do the National
Paleontology Society thing as agreed.

718
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:28,876
And we keep it very, very simple.

719
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,053
It's not as much fun as
whipping out my Lennie.

720
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:33,014
And why are we stopping here?

721
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:34,439
Have you tried these peaches?

722
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:37,851
You're back.

723
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,921
Yes, sir, we are.

724
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,344
We're addicted to your citrus.

725
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:42,525
Peaches aren't citrus, Shawn.
They're stone fruit.

726
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,317
- It's the same thing.
- No, not the same thing.

727
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:46,755
They have pits.
Peaches, cherries, plums, and apricots.

728
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:50,385
I can't do this with you right now.
Does your fruit come from Walker Farms?

729
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:53,551
Oh, no. We grow on our own
little parcel of land.

730
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:57,427
Deacon Walker's farm used to be
a supplier of ours years ago,

731
00:31:57,428 --> 00:31:59,948
but they don't grow nearly
as much as they used to.

732
00:32:01,905 --> 00:32:03,838
Thank you so much for your information.

733
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,330
If you have a moment, my friend and I
would like to buy every peach on that truck.

734
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:08,708
Including the one you're eating.

735
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:18,586
You sure you don't want
to do Of Mice And Men?

736
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:21,416
You so much as slur one word,
I'll give you an Indian burn so hot

737
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:22,852
your socks will catch fire.

738
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:24,000
"Indian burn. "

739
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:26,142
I haven't been threatened
with that this millennium.

740
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,790
Take a shot if your ulna feels safe.

741
00:32:28,454 --> 00:32:30,483
I don't think the ulna's in the forearm.

742
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:31,720
Trust me, it is.

743
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:35,296
- How can you Indian burn a bone?
- Stop analyzing my threat.

744
00:32:35,364 --> 00:32:36,901
- Get it right.
- I got it right.

745
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:39,877
- Deacon Walker?
- Sullivan Walker.

746
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:41,824
Is Deacon Walker home?

747
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,397
There is no Deacon Walker.

748
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,102
That's confusing.

749
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:48,941
I've got nothing.
Gus?

750
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:51,558
Then why name the farm
Deacon Walker Farms?

751
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:53,190
Because it used to be called
Deacon Walker.

752
00:32:53,191 --> 00:32:54,641
Roger Deacon was my partner.

753
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:55,600
He's not anymore.

754
00:32:56,468 --> 00:32:57,746
That cleans it up nicely.

755
00:32:57,796 --> 00:32:59,542
- Maybe we come in?
- No.

756
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:00,574
What do you want?

757
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,898
We're from the National
Paleontological Society...

758
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:03,882
Not interested.

759
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:08,467
Clearly he's not interested.

760
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:13,988
We would like to make you

761
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:16,570
a very sizeable offer
on a very small portion of your...

762
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:27,506
Hello, my name is Lennie.

763
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:28,606
I like to...

764
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:35,144
You think he'd open up
if we knocked again?

765
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:42,590
I'm glad it only took us
an hour to get up here.

766
00:33:42,662 --> 00:33:44,248
Not like I wasted a whole day.

767
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:48,598
Franzen dug up here too?

768
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:01,128
No, he didn't.

769
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:03,819
These are all new and
dug with a bulldozer.

770
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:04,989
A real paleontologist...

771
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:07,596
would never use such an indelicate tool.
I got it.

772
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,181
- So our farmer's been digging too.
- Right.

773
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,585
But if the gold mine's out there,
why is he digging over here?

774
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,062
It's my dad.

775
00:34:23,215 --> 00:34:24,850
Think he wants his leaf blower back?

776
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:27,812
Shawn?

777
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:30,013
Shawn, you're not anywhere
near that farmhouse, are you?

778
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:31,739
Dad, how dare you? Of course not.

779
00:34:31,824 --> 00:34:32,993
Good.
Stay away, Shawn.

780
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:34,369
I know where I rember that farm.

781
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,382
Deacon Walker Farm.
I was up there about 20 years ago.

782
00:34:37,437 --> 00:34:39,786
A girl reported that
her boyfriend went missing.

783
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:41,065
Roger Deacon.

784
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:42,792
He was a partner in the farm.

785
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:44,231
He was never found, Shawn.

786
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,493
Never found?

787
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,259
That's right, the farmer claimed he
went back to England or some nonsense.

788
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,473
The point is, we never found out
where he went.

789
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:52,605
I think I might know where he is.

790
00:34:52,654 --> 00:34:53,663
Where?

791
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,989
- I might be looking at him.
- Shawn!

792
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:57,046
Gotta go.

793
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:59,246
Shawn!
God...

794
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:01,815
- Dude.
- What?

795
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:07,740
It now appears a lot of our
evidence is circumstantial.

796
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:10,004
We're checking the grad
student's alibi, but...

797
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:11,775
I'm not as confident
as I like to be.

798
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:14,100
- Shawn Spencer's on line one.
- What does he want?

799
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,841
He wants us to go meet him
in the Ojai Valley somewhere.

800
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:18,698
We're in the middle
of the Franzen case.

801
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:19,879
I told him that.

802
00:35:19,977 --> 00:35:22,694
He guarantees that in ten minutes
he can solve the case,

803
00:35:22,695 --> 00:35:26,161
nab the killer, close an additional
unsolved murder, and...

804
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:29,043
And what?

805
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,687
Unearth a dinosaur.

806
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,748
Well... I'm curious.

807
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,430
This is as far as my property goes.
That's all there is.

808
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:51,973
Well, I've answered
all your questions, Detective.

809
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:53,952
What more do you want from me?

810
00:35:54,415 --> 00:35:57,025
- I'm not entirely sure, sir.
- We just have one more person

811
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:58,537
we need you to talk to.

812
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:02,499
Lennie?

813
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,319
Lennie?

814
00:36:04,368 --> 00:36:05,536
Don't even ask.

815
00:36:06,808 --> 00:36:08,708
My name is not Lennie, Mr. Walker.

816
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,028
But if it were,

817
00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:11,833
- I would've been amazing.
- No, you wouldn't have.

818
00:36:11,932 --> 00:36:13,082
Would've brought tears, Gus.

819
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,184
Guys, the point?

820
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,487
The truth is...

821
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:17,643
I'm a psychic.

822
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,826
I work for the SBPD.

823
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:21,256
And the mystic vibrations

824
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:22,604
of the sea have brought me here

825
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:27,034
to solve not one,
but two murders.

826
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,482
You're a what?

827
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:31,465
Christopher Franzen was
a persistent annoyance, huh?

828
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:32,706
He couldn't help it.

829
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,474
His department was going under.

830
00:36:34,517 --> 00:36:36,617
He was desperate to find
something significant

831
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,153
to save his career.

832
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:41,252
And he knew that your property
held the key.

833
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,324
But you wouldn't let him dig.

834
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:45,883
You couldn't let him dig.

835
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:48,650
So he did what any
self-respecting paleontologist

836
00:36:48,683 --> 00:36:51,136
on the verge of a nervous
breakdown would do.

837
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:53,199
He dug anyway.

838
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:55,276
Secretly.

839
00:36:55,337 --> 00:36:56,552
Under the blanket of night.

840
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:58,591
And into the early morning.

841
00:36:58,701 --> 00:37:03,817
And he dug, and he dug,
and he found something.

842
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:13,556
And that's when you found him.
You knew the magnitude

843
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:14,738
of the find.

844
00:37:14,794 --> 00:37:17,132
Once word got out,
you'd never be able to keep

845
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:18,890
the rest of the world
from digging here too.

846
00:37:18,935 --> 00:37:20,539
And you couldn't have
the rest of the world

847
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:22,166
digging here either,
could you?

848
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:23,259
Shawn!

849
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,028
Dad?

850
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:26,022
What are you doing here?

851
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:27,562
I was worried.

852
00:37:27,674 --> 00:37:29,354
About my tools.

853
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:31,272
What?

854
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,006
If I had known you were
finally smart enough

855
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,244
to bring some backup,
I wouldn't have had

856
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:35,061
to come up here, Shawn.

857
00:37:35,095 --> 00:37:37,393
Shawn, will you tell them
why Walker wouldn't let him dig?

858
00:37:37,495 --> 00:37:38,983
Roger Deacon.

859
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,838
Deacon is buried
on the property!

860
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,784
Dad!

861
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:45,609
Dad, you just blew
the big reveal.

862
00:37:45,774 --> 00:37:47,617
You already mentioned
his name, Shawn.

863
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:49,373
No, Deacon
was the partner

864
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:50,884
Walker killed 20 years ago.

865
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:53,133
- Hey, now wait a minute here...
- He what now?

866
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:56,597
Yeah, he killed Deacon
and he buried him

867
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:58,905
somewhere on the farm
and he can't rember where.

868
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,893
Isn't that right,
Farmer Shooty Pants?

869
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:03,435
I don't have to stand here
and take this.

870
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,161
No, actually you do.

871
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:07,194
What does this have to do
with Christopher Franzen?

872
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:09,282
He killed Franzen when he caught
him standing above his

873
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:12,184
dinosaur skull discovery,
sending him flying right into

874
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:14,089
the teeth of the dinosaur.

875
00:38:14,111 --> 00:38:15,481
But he couldn't bury him here.

876
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,393
No, no, no,
he had called the farm.

877
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:18,885
He had snooped around the farm.

878
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:19,928
There was a trail to the farm.

879
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:22,901
No, he had to dump him somewhere
where there'd be no forensics.

880
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:25,583
Like the ocean.

881
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:29,762
Just let the salt water clean
the corpse and wash it ashore.

882
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:31,320
And the murder scene.

883
00:38:31,364 --> 00:38:33,762
Well, he hopped on
his handy bulldozer

884
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:35,583
and filled the hole.

885
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,922
I'm getting a bad feeling
about your streak.

886
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:40,786
You too, huh?

887
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:42,675
I think I need a lawyer.

888
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,929
I think you're right.

889
00:38:43,952 --> 00:38:45,034
Put your hands
behind your back.

890
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,219
- What?
- You heard me.

891
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,286
You still haven't answered
the question

892
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:48,988
why he dug all the holes
around the house, Shawn.

893
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:51,969
Dad, that's the finale.

894
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:54,494
That's why I don't invite you
to these things.

895
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:59,077
He was looking
for Deacon's body.

896
00:38:59,122 --> 00:39:00,160
Whatever.

897
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:01,441
Are we done here, Mr. Spencer?

898
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:03,132
No, we're not done.

899
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:05,425
For my final demonstration...

900
00:39:07,154 --> 00:39:10,181
I will now...
discover a dinosaur.

901
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:11,784
Shawn!

902
00:39:11,956 --> 00:39:16,189
Actually... Gus will discover
a dinosaur.

903
00:39:16,778 --> 00:39:18,104
Wait a second.

904
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:19,910
You just want me
to dig this hole.

905
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:21,087
I do not.

906
00:39:21,187 --> 00:39:22,656
I'm not falling
for that, Shawny boy.

907
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:23,844
You dig it.

908
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:25,667
I'll take credit
for the discovery.

909
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,429
Oh, no, you won't.
Give me that shovel.

910
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:28,674
It's too late.

911
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:30,044
You blew it.
What?!

912
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,524
And whoever discovers it
gets to name it.

913
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:32,817
I'm naming him Zippy.

914
00:39:32,983 --> 00:39:34,364
Or Chompy.

915
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:37,176
Zippy the Dinosaur,
discovered by psychic

916
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:38,723
paleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer!

917
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:40,723
Give me this shovel,
Shawn!

918
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,795
Killed by a dinosaur.

919
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,484
And he's right.

920
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,263
It was an actual dinosaur.

921
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,733
Technically, it's the fall

922
00:39:58,777 --> 00:39:59,904
that killed him.

923
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,153
Not helping.

924
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:04,153
Who am I kidding?
I am doomed.

925
00:40:04,191 --> 00:40:06,346
I am never gonna suspect
an extinct creature.

926
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,528
How can I compete with that?

927
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:08,622
You don't have to compete.

928
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:11,296
O'Hara, I am physically incapable
of pointing the finger

929
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,621
at a dragon or a leprechaun
or the Loch Ness Monster.

930
00:40:15,254 --> 00:40:17,343
I quit. I'm gonna donate
my badge to charity.

931
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,469
It was a good run, Carlton.
All streaks have to end.

932
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,656
Lou Boudreau fielded
the ball cleanly.

933
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:24,074
You have to let it go.

934
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:26,303
Who the hell is Lou Boudreau?

935
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:29,186
He recorded the out that ended
DiMaggio's hit streak.

936
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,202
Don't you watch baseball?

937
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:31,197
Of course I watch baseball.

938
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,268
I just don't know meaningless

939
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:34,268
- facts from 75 years ago.
- 66.

940
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:35,728
You disturb me.

941
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:39,419
Do you need a hug?

942
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,204
Oh, what do I look like?

943
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:49,013
Yeah, I'll take the hug.

944
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,758
Okay, thanks.
Okay.

945
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:01,628
Oh, come on, you guys.

946
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:03,981
We're still doing
this intervention thing?

947
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:05,974
Yes, yes, Shawn,
we are.

948
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,135
Son, you have no sense
of responsibility.

949
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,096
And lately you've been
purposefully putting yourself

950
00:41:12,151 --> 00:41:13,985
in a severe amount
of unnecessary danger.

951
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:16,457
On top of which, you are
constantly belittling

952
00:41:16,502 --> 00:41:17,814
the good work of...
Actually, Henry,

953
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,686
I stretched the truth a bit.

954
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,442
This isn't about Shawn.

955
00:41:22,017 --> 00:41:24,188
- This is about you.
- What?

956
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,647
Can we talk about your obsessive
need for control?

957
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:30,050
You come into my house,
Devette.

958
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,580
You lie to me?!

959
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:32,958
Let's try to be rational.

960
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,378
Did you really drive all the
way up to Ojai just to crash

961
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:38,223
Shawn's crowning moment?

962
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:39,957
Get out.

963
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,499
Henry, we're here for you.

964
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,869
- At least listen.
- Out now.

965
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:45,884
Get out!

966
00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:48,515
Out!

967
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,051
I'd like to start.

968
00:41:50,095 --> 00:41:53,145
When I was about seven, he...
